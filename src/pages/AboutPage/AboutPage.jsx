          I just want to share a small note to you that I have learnt PHP and
          Laravel which is been used by your company as I saw in the
          presentation and word document, In my starting stage of programming I
          have learnt PHP and Laravel but while searching for jobs I was adapted
          to work on technologies with javascript frameworks like React js, Node
          js and Angular js in my previous companies. So I was not able to
          follow the updates of Laravel and PHP. In this case as I had a shorter
          time to complete this website design I have used React js and framer
          motion package for animations and toggling. As I was much practiced
          with React js I just created this application with React js, maybe if
          there would have been extra days to submit I would have gone throught
          some documentations of PHP and Laravel and would have worked on that
          frameworks.
